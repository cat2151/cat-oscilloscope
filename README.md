## Features

- 🎤 **Microphone Input** - Captures audio from the microphone in real-time
- 🎯 **Zero-Crossing Detection** - Automatically detects points where the audio crosses from negative to positive
- 📊 **Stable Display** - Aligns waveform display based on zero-crossing points for a stable view
- 🔊 **Auto Gain** - Automatically adjusts waveform amplitude to optimally utilize canvas height
- ⚡ **Real-time Rendering** - Continuously updates waveform visualization
- 🎨 **Classic Design** - Green waveform and grid overlay on a black background
- 🛡️ **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles microphone access permission issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Build

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be output to the `dist` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Testing

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Generate coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Start test UI:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for more details.

## How It Works

### Zero-Crossing Detection Algorithm

This oscilloscope implements a zero-crossing detection algorithm as follows:

1. Scans the audio buffer to detect points where the waveform crosses from negative (or zero) to positive
2. Identifies the first zero-crossing point
3. Finds the next zero-crossing point to determine one complete waveform cycle
4. Displays the waveform with a slight padding before and after the zero-crossing points

This achieves a stable, non-scrolling display.

### Technical Details

- **FFT Size**: 4096 samples for high resolution
- **Smoothing**: Disabled (0) for accurate waveform representation
- **Display Padding**: 20 samples before and after the zero-crossing points
- **Auto Gain**: 
  - Automatically adjusted to target 80% of canvas height
  - Smooth transitions via peak tracking (Decay rate: 0.95)
  - Gain range: 0.5x to 99x
  - Interpolation factor: 0.1 (gradual adjustment)
  - Toggleable via UI checkbox (Default: Enabled)
- **Canvas Resolution**: 800x400 pixels
- **Refresh Rate**: Synchronized with browser's requestAnimationFrame (approx. 60 FPS)

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Web Audio API** - Audio capture and analysis
- **HTML Canvas** - 2D waveform rendering

## Browser Requirements

This application requires the following:
- A modern browser supporting the Web Audio API (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- User permission for microphone access
- HTTPS or localhost (required for microphone access)
