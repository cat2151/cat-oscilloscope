You can try the application at the URL above. Microphone access permission is required.

※This document is provisional and largely generated by an LLM. It will be revised in the future.

## Status
- Major bugs have largely been addressed.
- Minor issues still exist.
- When using sound from a microphone, phase alignment is unstable, making practical use difficult.
- For simple monaural chip-tune waveforms from WAV files, the utility is high.
- Its ease of use as a library will be evaluated going forward.

## 📚 Usage as a Library

cat-oscilloscope can be used as an npm library in your own projects. For detailed instructions, please see [LIBRARY_USAGE.md](./LIBRARY_USAGE.md).

```typescript
import { Oscilloscope } from 'cat-oscilloscope';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const oscilloscope = new Oscilloscope(canvas);
await oscilloscope.start();
```

## Features

### Frequency Estimation

cat-oscilloscope supports 5 frequency estimation algorithms:

1.  **Zero-Crossing**: Simple and fast. Suitable for simple waveforms.
2.  **Autocorrelation**: Default. Offers balanced accuracy for complex waveforms.
3.  **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**: Frequency spectrum analysis. Strong for high frequencies.
4.  **STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)**: Improves low-frequency detection accuracy with variable window lengths.
5.  **CQT (Constant Q Transform)**: Provides high frequency resolution in the low-frequency range. Suitable for music analysis.

### Buffer Size Multiplier

To improve low-frequency detection accuracy, an extended buffer using past frame buffers is supported:

-   **1x (Standard)**: Standard buffer size (approx. 1/60th second)
-   **4x (Better Low Freq)**: 4x extended buffer for improved low-frequency detection accuracy
-   **16x (Best Low Freq)**: 16x extended buffer for the best low-frequency detection accuracy

**Usage Example**: For detecting low frequencies between 20-50Hz, selecting STFT or CQT and setting the Buffer Size to 16x is optimal.

**Important Notes:**
-   When changing the buffer size, the new buffer size will not take effect until the history has accumulated (up to 16 frames).
-   With a large buffer size (16x), initial frequency detection takes approximately 0.3 seconds.

### Detectable Frequency Range

The minimum detectable frequency varies depending on the buffer size:

-   **1x (4096 samples @ 48kHz)**: Approx. 80Hz and above (standard use)
-   **4x (16384 samples)**: Approx. 30Hz and above (improved low-frequency)
-   **16x (65536 samples)**: Approx. 20Hz and above (best low-frequency detection)

## Notes

-   Frequency Estimation
    -   There are cases where FFT is accurate, and cases where other methods are more accurate.
    -   STFT and CQT are particularly excellent at detecting low frequencies (20-100Hz).
    -   Increasing the buffer size multiplier improves low-frequency accuracy but slightly slows down responsiveness.
    -   **Performance**: With a 16x buffer size, STFT/CQT calculations may take longer (due to an implementation for educational purposes).

## About Data Processing Implementation

All data processing (waveform search, frequency estimation, zero-crossing detection, etc.) is **implemented in Rust/WASM**.

-   High processing performance
-   Type-safe and reliable implementation
-   TypeScript is responsible only for configuration management and rendering

### Building the WASM Implementation

The WASM implementation is located in the `wasm-processor` directory.

```bash
# Build the WASM implementation (wasm-pack required)
npm run build:wasm

# Build the entire application (including WASM)
npm run build
```

**Required Tools**:
-   Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
-   wasm-pack (`cargo install wasm-pack`)

## Features

-   🎤 **Microphone Input** - Captures audio from the microphone in real-time
-   🎯 **Zero-Crossing Detection** - Automatically detects points where the audio crosses from negative to positive
-   📊 **Stable Display** - Aligns waveform display based on zero-crossing points for a stable view
-   🔊 **Auto Gain** - Automatically adjusts waveform amplitude to optimally utilize canvas height
-   ⚡ **Real-time Rendering** - Continuously updates waveform visualization
-   🎨 **Classic Design** - Green waveform and grid overlay on a black background
-   🛡️ **Error Handling** - Properly handles microphone access permission issues
-   🔍 **Waveform Similarity Search** - Calculates similarity with the previous frame to achieve stable waveform display
-   🦀 **Rust/WASM Implementation** - All data processing algorithms implemented in Rust/WASM

## How it Works

### Zero-Crossing Detection Algorithm

This oscilloscope implements a zero-crossing detection algorithm as follows:

1.  Scans the audio buffer to detect points where the waveform crosses from negative (or zero) to positive
2.  Identifies the first zero-crossing point
3.  Finds the next zero-crossing point to determine one complete waveform cycle
4.  Displays the waveform with a slight padding before and after the zero-crossing points

This achieves a stable, non-scrolling display.

### Technical Details

-   **FFT Size**: 4096 samples for high resolution
-   **Smoothing**: Disabled (0) for accurate waveform representation
-   **Display Padding**: 20 samples before and after the zero-crossing points
-   **Auto Gain**:
    -   Automatically adjusts to target 80% of canvas height
    -   Smooth transitions via peak tracking (decay rate: 0.95)
    -   Gain range: 0.5x to 99x
    -   Interpolation factor: 0.1 (gradual adjustment)
    -   Toggleable via UI checkbox (default: enabled)
-   **Canvas Resolution**: 800x400 pixels
-   **Refresh Rate**: Synchronized with browser's requestAnimationFrame (approx. 60 FPS)

## Technology Stack

-   **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
-   **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
-   **Web Audio API** - Audio capture and analysis
-   **HTML Canvas** - 2D waveform rendering

## Browser Requirements

This application requires:
-   A modern browser supporting Web Audio API (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
-   User permission for microphone access
-   HTTPS or localhost (required for microphone access)

## Microphone Input Limitations

When using microphone input, the following limitations apply:

### Environmental Sound Effects

The microphone picks up all surrounding sounds, so the following environmental noises will affect the waveform:

- **Mouse Click Sounds**: The mechanical sound of clicking the mouse will appear in the waveform. In particular, the waveform may appear distorted when you click the pause button with the mouse.
- **Keyboard Typing Sounds**: Keyboard typing sounds also affect the waveform. However, if you use a keyboard with high quietness, the impact will be reduced.
- **Other Environmental Sounds**: Voices, indoor air conditioning sounds, and external noise will also appear in the waveform.

### Practical Tips

- **How to Pause**: Instead of mouse clicks, using the spacebar on a quiet keyboard can minimize the impact on the waveform when pausing.
- **Audio Source Selection**: Since microphone input is susceptible to environmental sounds, we recommend using audio files such as WAV files if you want to observe a noise-free waveform.
- **Measurement Environment**: Using the application in a quiet environment as much as possible allows for more accurate waveform observation.

These are characteristics of the microphone device, not limitations of the application.
