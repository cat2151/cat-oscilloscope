※ This document is a placeholder, and a large part of it was generated by an LLM. It will be revised in the future.

## Current Status
- Major bugs have been addressed.
- Minor issues still exist.
- When using sound from a microphone, phase alignment is unstable, making it impractical.
- When using simple monaural chip-tune waveforms from WAV files, it is highly practical.
- The ease of use as a library will be evaluated going forward.

## 📚 Usage as a Library

cat-oscilloscope can be used as an npm library in your own projects. For detailed instructions, please see [LIBRARY_USAGE.md](./LIBRARY_USAGE.md).

```typescript
import { Oscilloscope } from 'cat-oscilloscope';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas') as HTMLCanvasElement;
const oscilloscope = new Oscilloscope(canvas);
await oscilloscope.start();
```

## Features

### Frequency Estimation

cat-oscilloscope supports 5 frequency estimation algorithms:

1.  **Zero-Crossing**: Simple and fast. Suitable for simple waveforms.
2.  **Autocorrelation**: Default. Good balance of accuracy for complex waveforms.
3.  **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**: Frequency spectrum analysis. Strong for high frequencies.
4.  **STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)**: Improved low-frequency detection accuracy with variable window length.
5.  **CQT (Constant Q Transform)**: High frequency resolution in the low-frequency range. Suitable for music analysis.

### Buffer Size Multiplier

Supports extended buffers utilizing past frame buffers to improve low-frequency detection accuracy:

-   **1x (Standard)**: Standard buffer size (approx. 1/60 second)
-   **4x (Better Low Freq)**: 4x extended buffer for improved low-frequency detection accuracy
-   **16x (Best Low Freq)**: 16x extended buffer for the best low-frequency detection accuracy

**Usage Example**: For detecting low frequencies between 20-50Hz, selecting STFT or CQT and setting Buffer Size to 16x is optimal.

**Important Notes:**
- Changing the buffer size will not take effect until the history has accumulated (up to 16 frames)
- With a large buffer size (16x), initial frequency detection can take approximately 0.3 seconds

### Detectable Frequency Range

The minimum detectable frequency varies depending on the buffer size:

-   **1x (4096 samples @ 48kHz)**: Approx. 80Hz and above (standard use)
-   **4x (16384 samples)**: Approx. 30Hz and above (improved low frequency)
-   **16x (65536 samples)**: Approx. 20Hz and above (best low frequency detection)

## Notes

-   Frequency Estimation
    -   There are cases where FFT is accurate, and others where non-FFT methods are accurate.
    -   STFT and CQT are particularly good at detecting low frequencies (20-100Hz).
    -   Increasing the buffer size multiplier improves low-frequency accuracy but slightly increases response time.
    -   **Performance**: With a 16x buffer size, STFT/CQT calculations may take longer (due to implementation for educational purposes).

## About Data Processing Implementation

All data processing (waveform searching, frequency estimation, zero-crossing detection, etc.) is **implemented in Rust/WASM**.

-   High processing performance
-   Type-safe and reliable implementation
-   TypeScript is only responsible for configuration management and rendering

### Building the WASM Implementation

The WASM implementation is located in the `wasm-processor` directory.

```bash
# Build the WASM implementation (requires wasm-pack)
npm run build:wasm

# Build the entire application (including WASM)
npm run build
```

**Required Tools**:
-   Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo)
-   wasm-pack (`cargo install wasm-pack`)

## Features

-   🎤 **Microphone Input** - Real-time audio capture from your microphone
-   📂 **Audio File** - Supports looped playback of WAV files
-   📊 **Frequency Estimation** - 5 methods: Zero-Cross, Autocorrelation, FFT, STFT, CQT
-   🎹 **Piano Keyboard Display** - Displays detected frequencies on a piano keyboard
-   🎚️ **Auto Gain** - Automatically adjusts waveform amplitude
-   🔇 **Noise Gate** - Cuts off signals below a certain threshold
-   🎯 **3 Alignment Modes**
    -   **Zero-Cross**: Synchronizes at zero-crossing points (default)
    -   **Peak**: Synchronizes at peak points (for high frequencies)
    -   **Phase**: Phase synchronization (for subharmonics, addresses Issue #139)
-   📈 **FFT Spectrum** - Overlays the frequency spectrum
-   🔍 **Waveform Comparison Panel** - Displays the similarity between the current and previous waveforms
-   ⏸️ **Pause Drawing** - Allows observing a static waveform

### About Alignment Modes

**Phase Alignment Mode** was added to resolve phase drift in waveforms containing subharmonics, such as 1/4 overtones.

-   **Zero-Cross**: Lightest. Suitable for simple waveforms.
-   **Peak**: Stable in high-frequency or noisy environments.
-   **Phase**: DFT-based phase detection allows for stable display even with complex waveforms including subharmonics.

## How it Works

### Zero-Cross Detection Algorithm

This oscilloscope implements a zero-cross detection algorithm as follows:

1.  Scans the audio buffer to detect points where the waveform crosses from negative (or zero) to positive.
2.  Identifies the first zero-crossing point.
3.  Finds the next zero-crossing point to determine one complete waveform cycle.
4.  Displays the waveform with a slight padding before and after the zero-crossing points.

This achieves a stable, non-scrolling display.

### Technical Details

-   **FFT Size**: 4096 samples for high resolution
-   **Smoothing**: Disabled (0) for accurate waveform representation
-   **Display Padding**: 20 samples before and after the zero-crossing point
-   **Auto Gain**:
    -   Automatically adjusts to target 80% of canvas height
    -   Smooth transitions via peak tracking (decay rate: 0.95)
    -   Gain range: 0.5x to 99x
    -   Interpolation factor: 0.1 (gradual adjustment)
    -   Can be enabled/disabled via UI checkbox (default: enabled)
-   **Canvas Resolution**: 800x400 pixels
-   **Refresh Rate**: Synchronized with browser's requestAnimationFrame (approx. 60 FPS)

## Tech Stack

-   **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
-   **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
-   **Web Audio API** - Audio capture and analysis
-   **HTML Canvas** - 2D waveform rendering

## Browser Requirements

This application requires:
-   A modern browser that supports the Web Audio API (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
-   User permission for microphone access
-   HTTPS or localhost (required for microphone access)

## Constraints with Microphone Input

When using input from a microphone, the following constraints apply:

### Impact of Ambient Sound

The microphone picks up all surrounding sounds, so ambient noise can affect the waveform as follows:

-   **Mouse Clicks**: Mechanical sounds from mouse clicks will appear in the waveform. Specifically, the waveform may appear distorted at the moment the pause button is clicked with a mouse.
-   **Keyboard Typing Sounds**: Keyboard typing sounds also affect the waveform. However, the impact is reduced when using a silent keyboard.
-   **Other Ambient Sounds**: Speaking voices, indoor air conditioning sounds, and external noise will also appear in the waveform.

### Practical Tips

-   **Pausing**: Instead of mouse clicks, using the space key on a silent keyboard can minimize the impact on the waveform when pausing.
-   **Sound Source Selection**: Microphone input is susceptible to ambient noise, so if you want to observe a noise-free waveform, it is recommended to use audio files such as WAV files.
-   **Measurement Environment**: Use in as quiet an environment as possible to observe more accurate waveforms.

These are not limitations of the application itself, but rather characteristics of the microphone device.
